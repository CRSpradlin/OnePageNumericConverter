# OnePageNumericConverter
Created for Assignment 1 of our Data Communications Class.

# Features
- Created using only one HTML file.
- All conversion functions are defined recursively.
- First attempt at using BootStrap.

# Thoughts
- I still prefer W3CSS over BootStrap (native documentation is simply better and the code is easily changable)
